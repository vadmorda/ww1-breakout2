    <p>Inside a room with a dirty cherry wood floor, Jacques sits down, leaning his back against the wall. He removes his supply bag and rummages inside, pulling out a can of stewed meat and a piece of hard bread. He knows he must find more water. Now, he eats slowly, savoring the moment‚Äîit will be his only meal of the day. Later, he plans to rest for two or three hours before heading out under the cover of darkness. It is the safest time to travel through open fields. By dawn, he will have reached the forest, where the thick foliage will offer him protection. As he finishes eating, he lies down on the ground, and memories begin to flood his mind...</p>

    <div id="memory-text">
        <p>1. The Stalemate on the Western Front and Trench Warfare
By early 1915, the hopes of a swift war had collapsed. From the North Sea to Switzerland, armies were entrenched in a grueling and static conflict. Germany, under General Erich von Falkenhayn, shifted its focus to defeating Russia in the East while holding defensive positions in the West. Meanwhile, France and Britain refused to concede the initiative and sought alternative strategies to break the deadlock.
2. The Gallipoli Campaign and the Failed Dardanelles Offensive
Believing a Western Front breakthrough was unlikely, Britain sought a new theater of war in Asia Minor. The goal was to eliminate Turkey, open the Dardanelles Strait to aid Russia, and tighten the encirclement of the Central Powers. However, two naval offensives in February and March ended in failure, with the loss of several British and French warships. This led to an amphibious landing on April 25 at Gallipoli, involving British, French, Australian, and New Zealand troops. The Allies, facing fierce Turkish resistance and challenging terrain, remained trapped along the coast, suffering heavy casualties. By late 1915, the campaign was abandoned, marking a disastrous defeat for the Allies.
3. The Balkans: Serbia‚Äôs Defeat and Bulgaria‚Äôs Entry into the War
While the Gallipoli front collapsed, the Central Powers gained momentum in the Balkans. In late 1915, Germany and Austria-Hungary, supported by newly allied Bulgaria, launched a decisive offensive against Serbia. The Serbian army was forced into a grueling retreat through the mountains to the Adriatic coast. The Allies attempted to intervene via Salonika, Greece, but arrived too late to prevent Serbia's collapse.
4. French Military Leadership and the Struggles on the Western Front
General Joseph Joffre, hailed as a hero after the "Miracle of the Marne," remained committed to offensive strategies. He launched repeated assaults in Champagne and Artois, believing in the doctrine of "attaque √† outrance" (attack to excess). Despite deploying hundreds of thousands of men and artillery, these offensives yielded minimal territorial gains while causing massive casualties. The German defenses, strengthened by superior artillery and fortifications, repelled French advances. Joffre‚Äôs relentless strategy reflected a failure to adapt to the realities of modern trench warfare.
5. The Introduction of Steel Helmets and Equipment Shortages
As trench warfare prolonged, head injuries became common. Initially dismissing the need for protective gear, Joffre prioritized artillery production over helmets. However, by mid-1915, August-Louis Adrian designed a steel helmet that was mass-produced, with 3 million delivered by year‚Äôs end. Meanwhile, France faced severe shortages of rifles and ammunition, leading to the hurried adaptation of outdated weaponry and the production of the Chauchat light machine gun.
6. The Rise of Chemical Warfare and the Battle of Ypres
Germany, Europe‚Äôs leading industrial power, turned to chemical warfare to break the stalemate. Under the supervision of chemist Fritz Haber, Germany developed chlorine gas, despite its prohibition under the 1899 Hague Conventions. On April 22, at Ypres in Belgium, the German army released chlorine gas, killing over 5,000 Allied soldiers. However, the Germans failed to capitalize on the ensuing chaos. Both sides soon improved gas delivery methods and protective measures, escalating the brutality of warfare.
7. Localized Battles and the ‚ÄúWar of the Moles‚Äù
Throughout 1915, numerous small-scale operations sought minor territorial gains. French and German troops engaged in relentless battles in sectors like Argonne, Vosges, and Artois, resulting in thousands of deaths for mere meters of land. In Vauquois, mining warfare became prevalent, with both sides tunneling under enemy positions to detonate explosives. This underground struggle further exemplified the horrors of trench warfare.
8. Censorship, Propaganda, and the Reality of War
The French government strictly controlled war reporting, censoring criticism of military strategies. The public was bombarded with propaganda about Allied successes, German suffering under blockade, and exaggerated enemy losses. Soldiers, meanwhile, endured horrific conditions‚Äîcold, hunger, filth, and the omnipresence of death. Some turned to creating "trench art" or clandestine newspapers to cope with the war‚Äôs psychological toll.
9. The Italian Front: Italy Joins the Allies
After months of negotiations, Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies in May 1915, declaring war on Austria-Hungary. This new front, however, quickly became another brutal and costly battlefield, with little strategic progress.
10. The Eastern and Middle Eastern Fronts
On the Eastern Front, Germany and Austria-Hungary pushed Russian forces back over 100 miles but failed to destroy them. Meanwhile, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers and, alongside Germany and Austria, overran Serbia. In the Middle East, British forces defended the Suez Canal against Ottoman advances but suffered a major setback in Mesopotamia when an army moving toward Baghdad was forced to surrender.
11. Planning for 1916: The War Shows No End in Sight
By December 1915, Joffre was named Commander-in-Chief of the French armies. Despite heavy casualties, he remained committed to large-scale offensives. At a conference in Chantilly, the Allies agreed on a coordinated strategy to attack on all fronts in 1916. Meanwhile, Germany shifted focus to the Western Front, preparing for a decisive assault on Verdun.
1915 was a year of disillusionment. The war had devolved into a deadly stalemate, with trench warfare, mass casualties, and failed offensives defining the conflict. Attempts to break through in Gallipoli and the Western Front had ended in disaster. Meanwhile, new horrors, such as chemical weapons and underground warfare, intensified the suffering of soldiers. As 1916 loomed, both sides prepared for even bloodier battles, with no clear end in sight.</p>

                Jacques wakes up startled by the sound of rats scurrying around, attempting to steal some of his food. 
                He quickly dusts himself off, cracks his back, and gathers his belongings. As he looks around, 
                he notices a nightstand with several objects‚Äîone of them catches his eye: a **bronze key**. 
                He picks it up, feeling its cold metal in his hands. Along with it, a piece of paper with some apparent gibberish written on it.
